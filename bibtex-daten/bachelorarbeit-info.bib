  title       = {Comparing the Performance of L*A*B* and HSV Color Spaces with Respect to Color Image Segmentation},
  abstract    = {Color image segmentation is a very emerging topic for image processing research. Since it has the ability to present the result in a way that is much more close to the human yes perceive, so todays more research is going on this area. Choosing a proper color space is a very important issue for color image segmentation process. Generally LAB and HSV are the two frequently chosen color spaces. In this paper a comparative analysis is performed between these two color spaces with respect to color image segmentation. For measuring their performance, we consider the parameters: mse and psnr . It is found that HSV color space is performing better than LAB.},
